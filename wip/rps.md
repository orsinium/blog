1. **Suggest the first move**. Show them how to play, each time showing the move that you want them to pick. People are likely to mimic you.
1. **Start with *paper* agains male, with *rock* against female**. Men start with a *rock*, women start with *scissors*.
1. If they win, pick what beats them. If they play stone and you lose with *scissors*, play *paper* next. People are lickely to stick to the same move if they won with it.
1. **If they win twice in a row with the same move, stick to your move**. If they play *rock* twice and win (you had *scissors*), stick to *scissors*. They will pick something different: either *scissors* or *paper*.
1. **If they lose twice in a row with the same move, pick what they would beat**. If they lose twice with *scissors*, pick *paper* next. People switch from losing move to something different.
1. **Prefer *paper***. *Rock* is the most common move (because it's easeir to form), *scissors* is the least common move. It's especially true for the first move.
1. **Prefer *paper* if opponent loses too many times**. When people are frustrated, they throw *rock*. A clenched fist better expresses their anger.
1. **Announce your move once**. They will think that you are bluffing and expect you to pick something else.
1. **Look for clues**. Fingers often betray in advance the next move.
