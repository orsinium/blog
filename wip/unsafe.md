# Why Go isn't safe

## The billion dollar mistake

...

## Integer overflow

...

## Underutilized uint and int64

...

## Underutilized generics

...

## No exhaustiveness check

...

## Overutilized panics

...

## Underutilized custom types

...

## Tuples instead of monads for errors

...

## Types only for runtime, not safety

...

## No compile-time code execution

rust macros

zig compiletime

## Struct field tags

...

## Code in comments

...

## Everything has a default

...

## Struct fields may be omitted

...

## Any pointer is mutable

...

## Implementing interface is implicit

...

## Int is platform-dependent

...

## Append may mutate or may not

...

## No immutable built-in collections

...
